# VPN Protocols Explained

VPN protocols determine how your data is routed through a connection. Each protocol offers different benefits in terms of speed, security, and capabilities.

## OpenVPN

**Security Level: High**

OpenVPN is an open-source protocol that uses SSL/TLS encryption and is highly configurable. It's considered one of the most secure protocols available.

- **Pros**: Strong security, bypasses firewalls, open-source auditing
- **Cons**: Can be slower than newer protocols
- **Best for**: Users prioritizing security over speed

## WireGuard

**Security Level: High**

WireGuard is a newer protocol designed to be simpler, faster, and more secure than existing options.

- **Pros**: Extremely fast, efficient code base, modern encryption
- **Cons**: Relatively new, less tested than established protocols
- **Best for**: Users wanting maximum speed with good security

## IKEv2/IPSec

**Security Level: High**

IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2) paired with IPSec provides strong security and excellent reconnection capabilities.

- **Pros**: Fast, stable, good for mobile devices, automatic reconnection
- **Cons**: Can be blocked by firewalls, limited platform support
- **Best for**: Mobile users who frequently switch networks

## L2TP/IPSec

**Security Level: Medium-High**

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol combined with IPSec encryption provides good security for most use cases.

- **Pros**: Widely supported, easy to set up
- **Cons**: Can be slower, potentially compromised by NSA
- **Best for**: Basic security needs when other protocols aren't available
