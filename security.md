# VPN Security Best Practices

## Choosing a Secure VPN

1. **Verify the encryption standard**: Look for AES-256 encryption
2. **Check the VPN protocol**: WireGuard and OpenVPN are currently considered the most secure
3. **Confirm no-logs policy**: Choose providers with independently audited no-logs policies
4. **Look for DNS leak protection**: Ensure your DNS requests aren't exposed
5. **Ensure IPv6 leak protection**: Many VPNs should block IPv6 to prevent leaks
6. **Verify kill switch functionality**: This prevents data exposure if the VPN connection drops

## Potential VPN Security Risks

- **Free VPN services**: Often collect and sell user data or inject ads
- **Jurisdiction matters**: VPNs based in 14-Eyes countries may be subject to intelligence sharing
- **Logging policies**: Some VPNs claim "no logs" but actually record user activities
- **WebRTC leaks**: Browser-based technology that can reveal your real IP even with a VPN

## Testing Your VPN Security

Run these tests after connecting to your VPN:

1. **IP leak test**: Visit [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) to verify your IP is masked
2. **DNS leak test**: Use [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com) to check for DNS leaks
3. **WebRTC leak test**: Visit [browserleaks.com/webrtc](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc)
4. **IPv6 leak test**: Check at [ipv6leak.com](https://ipv6leak.com)

## VPN Limitations

VPNs provide privacy but are not perfect security solutions:

- Do not protect against all tracking methods (like browser fingerprinting)
- Cannot protect you from malware or phishing
- Won't anonymize you if you log into personal accounts
- May be blocked by some services (Netflix, banks, etc.)
