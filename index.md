# VPN Comparison Guide

## What is a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection to protect your privacy and allows you to browse securely on public networks. VPNs also enable users to bypass geographical restrictions and access content from different regions.

## Why Use a VPN?

- **Privacy**: Hide your browsing activity from ISPs and third parties
- **Security**: Protect your data when using public Wi-Fi
- **Access**: Bypass geo-restrictions and censorship
- **Anonymous browsing**: Mask your IP address and location
